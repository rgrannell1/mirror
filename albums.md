It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site with a large (and fairly tame) puffin population. I personally think it's the most beautiful place in Ireland. |

Lighting aside, I got extremely lucky and managed to get a picture of our elusive (but recovering) pine-marten |

In "rutting season", the stags bellow and battle each other for mates. I risked getting close (at some personal risk) to get better photos, until an extremely irritated park ranger caught up to me. But at that point, I had the photos! |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/77879c835b.webp) | Chester Zoo | chester-zoo-21 | England | I was lucky enough to see the small-clawed otters at feeding time. They were extremely noisy and pleased by their meals, and I got a few cute videos and pictures |

I doubt she's popular with her neighbours; herons are colloquially known as 'shitepokes' due to their habit of ... when taking off. The paint-jobs of the expensive cars here are a bit tarnished |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/a1f7e67d84.webp) | Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago | lincoln-park-zoo-22 | United States of America | I saw a large number of wasps in the bushes in Lincoln Park Zoo. I wanted a photo, but as a rule of thumb, large nest-building wasps are fairly aggressive. I quickly searched Wikipedia, and made a plausible guess at the species (Sphex pensylvanicus, the great black wasp). It appeared to be a digger wasp, and by my theory should be fairly friendly. Thankfully, they didn't prove me wrong. |

I'd visited the year before, and taken [many more photos](https://photos.rgrannell.xyz/#/album/rutting-season-21), but it was nice to get a lucky (if distant) photo of a Kestrel on the trip down |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/57fb8951df.webp) | Lapwings, Emo, Laois | lapwings-22 | Ireland | [Lapwings](/#/thing/bird:vanellus-vanellus) are Ireland's national bird. Their population has declined due to habitat loss and changes in farming practice (they are ground-nesting like curlews). I was lucky enough to see a few lapwings in a ploughed field near Emo, Co. Laois. They are graceful fliers and have an especially beautiful song |

| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/bb27a9d26f.webp) | Wisconsin | wisconsin-state-24 | United States of America | The biodiversity and presence of nature in Wisconsin was surprising. Practically every lamp-post had a percehd [red-tailed hawk](/#/thing/bird:buteo-jamaicensis), vultures were circling over the fields, and there were several osprey over the lakes. The abundance of nature was enviable from an Irish perspective |

The architecture was beautiful, and I enjoyed walking through Tiergarten. I briefly, nominally, visited Museum Island, but got distracted and decided to walk around in the snow instead. |

For a few moments I was genuinely worried they would drop into the Irish Sea. |

This year, presumably for reasons of safety or Irish neutrality, we instead diverted a US-Boston flight which flew about 200m above the stadium. Less dramatic, but it's stil uncanny seeing a place fly so low across the city |

| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/9a1c8db6a3.webp) | Córdoba | cordoba-24 | Spain | Córdoba is obscenely pretty. The Mosque-Cathedral has striking rows of Moorish Ablaq arches & a beautiful orange grove courtyard. The 331 metre Roman bridge across the Guadalquivir river gave me a great view of the city, and I saw to animals I've been trying to photograph for years; a kingfisher and an [eurasian otter](/#/thing/mammal:lutra-lutra). I only successfully photographed the latter |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/4c061c00f6.webp) | Cádiz | cadiz-24 | Spain | I only briefly visited Cádiz (an coastal Phoenecian-founded city in Andalusia) so took less photos than I ought to have. I was amazed my how many birds of prey I saw on the trip there from Seville, it would have been an amazing place to take wildlife photos. Next time... |

| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/6bfe2a4f4f.webp) | Granada | granada-24 | Spain | I visited Granada at the end of a long trip through Spain. The Nasrid palaces are the most beautiful buildings I've ever seen or am likely to see. I really like Islamic tilework (which is obvious from how prevelant pictures of tilework are in this album) and the Alhambra has many beautiful variations (at least [twelve of seventeen](https://www.ams.org/notices/200606/comm-grunbaum.pdf) possible [wallpaper symmetry groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group)) |

| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/8f64e7b144.webp) | Ireland's Eye | irelands-eye-24 | Ireland | Ireland's Eye is a small island off the coast of Howth, underneath the flight path into Dublin. It's the first part of Ireland I'd fly over returning to Ireland, but it took me a long time to actually visit it. Like our other island's (Saltees, Skellig Micheal, etc) it is home to [puffins](/#/thing/bird:fratercula-arctica), [gannets](/#/thing/bird:morus-bassanus), and other photogenic sea-birds |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/00ec3d180f.webp) | London | london-24 | England | On this trip I visited the V&A Museum and the Science musesum. I stayed in the Vanterbilt-mansion-turnt-middling-hotel (I couldn't pass up that opportunity). I hadn't looked up what was on display in the V&A (I was going because it was recommended to me), but I was surprised to see a (casting, presumable) of Michelangelo's David. |

| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/6d5af18fee.webp) | Mount Teide | mount-tiede-24 | Tenerife | We visited Mount Teide at night with a tour group, and took photos at 2,500m altitude (well above the lights and clouds). The milky way was clearly visible, and it was possible to distinguish the colour of stars. My 84mm equivalent Voigtländer lens was surprisingly adept at astrophotography, though my gerry-rigged tripod (a folded-up coat) was not ideal. |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/75d5f6370c.webp) | Oslo & Stockholm | oslo-and-stockholm-24 | Norway,Sweden | Two beautiful countries. I probably didnt' see the best of Norway staying in Oslo (it's nice, but I really should have went hiking and exploring the countryside). The train-trip from Oslo to Stockholm was nice; the landscape was pretty different between the two countries. Norway seemed more densely forested, Sweden had endless lakes.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to see [Fieldfares](/#/thing/bird:turdus-pilaris) in summer; they migrate to Ireland in winter but I had no idea where they migrated back to. |

| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/90d949223d.webp) | Seville | seville-24 | Spain | I was lucky enough to photograph hundreds of [migratory storks](/#/thing/bird:ciconia-ciconia) circling on the thermals above the city. I've often spotted them before nested from trains while travelling through the continent, but have never got a decent photo of even one. |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/22aadba574.webp) | Swifts & Martins | swifts-and-martins-24 | Ireland | I spotted these birds getting a taxi from South Dublin to the centre. The next day, I spent the afternoon squinting at the sun and spinning in circles trying to get the birds in focus. |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/4dd7586211.webp) | Tenerife | tenerife-24 | Tenerife | I didn't see the rainforests near [Anaga](/#/thing/geoname:2521768) this trip, but the wildlife and flora were still amazing. There's swifts and parrots everywhere, and the forests along Mount Teide are really beautiful (though sadly unphotograpphed this time) |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/56954c5d19.webp) | York | york-24 | England | The highlight of my trip to York was renting an extremely slow-moving boat, sailing it with a mild sense of panic, and carefully navigating around the occasional geese that were floating down the river Ouse. |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/3dd12452d2.webp) | Anaga Rural Park | anaga-25 | Tenerife | Anaga Rural Park is located in Macizo de Anaga, a cool, damp, cloudy mountain range. It's a laurel rainforest (which bears an odd resemblence to the remnants of Killarney's temperate rainforest) with many endemic species. |

| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/2196642deb.webp) | Cologne | cologne-25 | Germany | I briefly visited Cologne for a work conference. I didn't get much time for sightseeing, but I did at least see the enormous cathedral |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/7d0f0e2d9a.webp) | Conwy | conwy-25 | Wales | Conwy is a compact town with an enormous castle. It's visitable from Dublin with an overnight stay, but barely (ferry's are slow!) |

| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/da867d06fa.webp) | Howth | howth-25 | Ireland | I was lucky enough to spot and (badly) photograph a raven for the first time while hiking up the cliffs overlooking Howth. |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/e261da6ed7.webp) | La Lagunas | la-lagunas-25 | Tenerife | San Cristóbal de La Laguna is a UNESCO world-heritage site due to its early grid-pattern non-fortified colonial town layout |

| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/3f792fe52e.webp) | Segovia | segovia-25 | Spain | I finally took some pictures of the birds of prey I'd see as while travelling between cities in Spain; they were circling the fields around the train-station outside Segovia. The city itself, as expected, was beautiful. |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/f6dd565ade.webp) | Sintra | sintra-25 | Portugal | Sintra was more verdant than I expected; it reminded me a little of Anaga's rainforest. I visited the Castle of the Moors and took a (bad) photo of Pena Castle from a castle turret. |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/7fc6f0c3bd.webp) | Slovenia | slovenia-25 | Slovenia | Slovenia is a wonderful, forested country with enormous mountain ranges and beautiful architecture from various eras (a lot of Yugoslav buildings & monuments are still standing in the capital Ljublana). It's also home to the [olm](/#/thing/amphibian:proteus-anguinus), a blind cave-dwelling neotenous salamander (that was surprisingly difficult to photograph). |
| ![](https://photos-cdn.rgrannell.xyz/1162f0e139.webp) | Toledo | toledo-25 | Spain | Toledo is a beautiful hilltop city not far from Madrid. It has a history of religious diversity, with synagogues, mosques, and churches built in the same city (and with architectural styles overlapping in interesting ways in Sinagoga del Tránsito). My picture of the city and the Alcázar was taken by frantically running off the tourist bus, grabbing a few hasty photos from a nearby wall, and running back to the bus before I was stranded. |
